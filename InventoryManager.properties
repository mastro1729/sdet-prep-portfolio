# You are required to implement a simple inventory management check using Java.

1. Define a local class named InventoryItem inside the main method.
	The class should have the following fields:
		a. int productId
		b. String name
		c. int quantity
		d. int restockLevel

2. The class should include a constructor that initializes all the above fields.

3. Use a collection interface to store multiple InventoryItem objects, using productId as the key.

4. Add at least two inventory items to the collection.

5. Iterate over the collection and check whether the item needs restocking:
	If quantity < restockLevel, print: Alert! <item_name> needs restock
	Otherwise, print: <item_name> - Quantity: <quantity>, Restock Level: <restockLevel>

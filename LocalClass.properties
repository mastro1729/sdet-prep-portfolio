# What is a Local Class in Java?
# A local class is a class that is defined inside a method, including the main() method.
# A local class is declared within the body of a method, constructor, or initializer block 
# and the method can be any access level (public, private, protected, or default).
	
	# method_scope can be public, private, etc.
	# return_type can be void, int, String, etc.
	# The class declared inside is a local class, and it cannot have an access modifier or be static.
	
# Key Points:
# It is local to the method where it is defined.
# You cannot use public, protected, or private access modifiers with it.
# It can access final or effectively final local variables of the method.
# It's mostly used for encapsulating small helper logic that doesn't need to be reused elsewhere.
